# Post-Campaignon-on-Digital-Marketing (Python)

Analyzed an end-to-end marketing campaign process from the designing the business needs followed by customer segmentation, marketing channel analyzing, targeting groups, predictive modeling,
A/B testing, execution and finally a post-campaign analysis.

#### Data Exploration and Data Cleaning

At first, I explored the dataset to understand different columns, unique values of each column and the distribution of values. I cleaned the data in terms of missing values and removed
all duplications. 

#### Data Analysis

In the data anlysis part we answered the following questions-

* How many users receive marketing offers by day?
* What is the overall conversion and retention rate? 
* What is the daily response rate? - Visualized the daily response rate by a line chart
 
 #### Customer Segmentation Analysis
